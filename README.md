This repository contains a NextJS starter app built on top of the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses).
It leverages built-in tools ([web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=responses) and [file search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search)) and implements a chat interface with multi-turn conversation handling.

Features:

- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Web search tool configuration
- Vector store creation & file upload for use with the file search tool
- Function calling
- Streaming responses & tool calls
- Display annotations
- Google Calendar & Gmail integration via 1P connectors

This app is meant to be used as a starting point to build a conversational assistant that you can customize to your needs.

## How to use

1. **Set up the OpenAI API:**

   - If you're new to the OpenAI API, [sign up for an account](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
   - Follow the [Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to retrieve your API key.

2. **Set the OpenAI API key:**

   2 options:

   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable [globally in your system](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key)
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in the project: Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following line (see `.env.example` for reference):

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-responses-starter-app.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   Run in the project root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Google integration (Calendar & Gmail)

This starter app includes a built-in Google integration that lets the assistant read your calendar and email inbox via OpenAI's 1P connectors. The app performs a secure OAuth (PKCE) flow in your browser, stores tokens per session, and attaches the Google connector to the Responses API tool list at request time.

### Setup (Google OAuth)

1. Create an OAuth 2.0 client for a Web application in your Google Cloud project (see [documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) for accessing Google APIs with Oauth 2.0 docs).
   - In Google Cloud, go to APIs & Services > Google Auth platform > Clients > Create client > **Web**.
   - Add your redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/google/callback`.
   - Copy the client ID. Create and copy a client secret.
2. Enable APIs in the same project:
   - Google Calendar API
   - Gmail API
3. Configure data access scopes in Google Auth Platform to match what you need. This demo uses:
   - `openid`
   - `email`
   - `profile`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
4. Create `.env.local` at the project root and add:

   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
   # Optional: override if you use a different callback URL
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/google/callback"
   ```

5. Start the dev server if not already running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Demo flow

- Click "Connect Google Integration" in the UI and complete the OAuth flow; you will be redirected back with `connected=1`.
- Ask the assistant to perform tasksâ€”for example, "Show my next five calendar events," or, "Summarize the most recent wirecutter emails".
- The app will attach Google Calendar and Gmail connectors (via MCP) to the tool list using your access token and stream results back to the UI.
- To invalidate the OAuth session, clear the app cookies (Chrome DevTools > Application > Storage > Cookies). If you only clear `gc_access_token`, the app will use the `gc_refresh_token` to refresh without re-authenticating.
